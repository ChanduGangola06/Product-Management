product-management-web remove vite

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Removing Vite from the project**

I need to remove Vite from the product-management-web project; it’s a bit tricky. This involves replacing build tooling, and I’m considering options like plain React with webpack, Parcel, or create-react-app, but the latter feels too heavy. Alternatively, I might use TypeScript with React and esbuild while serving with a simple static server. I’ll need to edit files, adjust scripts in package.json, and update some HTML references, taking care with the hashed asset names created by Vite.
**Implementing esbuild for the project**

I’m planning to switch to esbuild to handle the bundling for product-management-web. I’ll modify the package.json to remove Vite and add esbuild along with necessary plugins, particularly for CSS. The scripts I need include a development command for bundling and watching files, and a build command that minifies the code for production. I’ll make sure to set up the proper HTML files to include the newly generated bundles. I’ll also confirm that CSS imports work, as esbuild can bundle those too.
**Configuring esbuild for CSS and development server**

I need to set up esbuild to handle CSS extraction properly. I can enable CSS loading with a specific flag and bundle it, but for separate files, I’ll also need to use a metafile. By default, esbuild bundles CSS into JS, but I can configure it for separate outputs if needed. For local development, I can run a server using esbuild with directory serving and watching for changes. Finally, I’ll adjust the index.html to ensure it references the correct bundle path.
**Adjusting HTML for esbuild**

I see that the `product-management-web/index.html` is currently set up for Vite, using a module script for the main file. To adapt this for esbuild, I need to either create a new `public` folder or modify the root index.html to reference the bundled `./bundle.js` in the dist directory. I’ll check the vite.config.ts for configurations before finalizing changes, ensuring everything lines up for the esbuild setup and serves correctly from the dist folder.</details></think>

---

I'll check the web app's config and key files to plan the removal of Vite and switch to an esbuild-based setup. Then I'll update `package.json`, remove `vite.config.ts`, and adjust `index.html` to load the esbuild bundle.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering build tool changes**

I’m thinking we need to remove Vite from product-management-web and switch to esbuild. Since there was a precommitted plan, we have to implement it. My first step will be to modify the `product-management-web/package.json` to take out Vite scripts and add esbuild build/dev scripts, along with an equivalent dev server proxy. I might also consider using esbuild with serve or react-refresh for development. Let's take a closer look at the package.json and source files for entry points.</details></think>

---

I'll scan the web app's key files to replace Vite with an esbuild-based setup: checking `package.json` for scripts/deps, `src/main.tsx` and `index.html` for entry points and HTML mounting. I'll do these reads in parallel.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating project files**

I need to perform some edits, like updating the `package.json`, creating script files, and modifying `index.html`. I should also delete `vite.config.ts` and add the devDependencies. It’s important to actually modify the content in `package.json` using `apply_patch`, and I must remember the Windows path here. I’ll make sure to preserve the indentation style, as JSON requires a two-space indentation. Let’s implement these changes!</details></think>

I'll replace Vite with an esbuild-based setup: update `package.json` scripts and devDependencies, add build/dev/preview scripts using esbuild and an express static server with proxy, update `index.html` to load the esbuild bundle, and remove `vite.config.ts`. I'll make all file edits now.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring esbuild and CSS Bundling**

I'm thinking about how esbuild works with CSS imports in JS when bundling. By default, with bundle set to true, it can generate a separate CSS file if I'm using 'metafile' and 'write'. Vite and webpack handle extraction a bit differently. If I use the 'css' loader, it will generate a CSS file and I need to adjust my HTML with a link tag. Alternatively, using the 'style' loader could eliminate the need to modify the HTML. So, I should align the naming in my code!
**Configuring esbuild for CSS Output**

I'm setting the entryNames to 'index' and assetNames to 'assets/[name]'. With CSS bundling, I think the default output file is 'index.css' in the output directory. It seems esbuild will put the CSS in the outdir with the same name as the entry. So, I'll set the outdir to 'dist/assets', keep entryNames as 'index', and turn off code splitting. I also need to update index.html to include a link to '/assets/index.css' and implement the scripts. Let’s get started!</details></think>

---

I'll create esbuild-based build/dev/preview scripts, update `index.html` to load the built bundle and CSS, and remove the Vite config. Then I'll run a quick linter check on changed files.

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Setting up an express server**

I’m planning to create an express server using esbuild with context and in watch mode, ensuring to log on rebuilds. This server will serve the `dist` directory and proxy specific routes to http://localhost:4000. Additionally, I’m making sure that index.html is served at the root and correctly references assets like `index.js` and `index.css`. I’ll also create a simple static server for local previews and remove unnecessary Vite configurations. Time to implement these scripts!</details></think>

---

I'll add esbuild-based dev/build/preview scripts, remove the Vite config, and set up an Express static server with proxy for dev. Then I'll run a quick check for any linter issues in the modified directory.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Understanding esbuild bundling**

I'm looking at the esbuild documentation for bundling with CSS entry points. When I use the CSS loader, it should create both a CSS file and a JS file if I set 'outdir' and 'write' to true. For example, if the main.tsx imports './styles.css', esbuild generates index.js and index.css in the output directory. I need to integrate preview.mjs and dev.mjs to properly serve the dev environment, ensuring everything compiles and proxies API requests correctly.
**Updating project setup**

I need to remove Vite dependencies and the vite.config.ts file, which I've done by modifying the package.json devDependencies. It's good to delete vite.config.ts now. For the preview, I'll serve the built distribution on a port and proxy requests for /api and /health to the backend at localhost:4000. I'll implement dev.mjs to run esbuild with watch mode, starting an Express server on port 5173. It’s essential to manage cache headers and log rebuild errors. Finally, I should create scripts for preview.mjs and dev.mjs and consider adding a README.
**Cleaning up project files**

I realize we should remove the product-management-web/dist/index.html since Vite created it, but it feels fine to keep it for now. Let's focus on implementing the dev.mjs and preview.mjs and deleting vite.config.ts. Running read_lints might be unnecessary since there’s no linter configured, so I’ll skip that. I also need to adjust index.html asset paths so that during development, the server serves 'dist' at the root path, mapping '/assets' correctly. Finally, I'll implement Express to serve static files and set necessary tool calls like applying patches.
**Ensuring correct file paths**

I need to make sure I'm using path.resolve for Windows paths in the implementation. It’s important to handle file paths correctly to avoid any issues with cross-platform compatibility. I'll focus on implementing this as the next step in my process. By ensuring the right file resolution, I'm helping to create a smoother experience for anyone using this code on Windows. Let's get started on that!</details></think>

---

I'm going to finish removing Vite by adding working `scripts/dev.mjs` and `scripts/preview.mjs` (esbuild watch and static server with API proxy), and delete `product-management-web/vite.config.ts`. Then I'll confirm the HTML and build script alignment.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating task specs**

I’m thinking we should provide status updates and summaries as specified. We didn’t use the todo_write tool, but that might not be necessary for this medium task. Still, the specifications suggest using it for multi-step tasks. We primarily need to ensure build scripts are in place and manage CSS output correctly. In esbuild, using the CSS loader can either inline CSS or generate a separate file. That's something to clarify to make sure we're bundling correctly!
**Clarifying esbuild process**

I remember that esbuild can extract CSS into a separate file under certain conditions when CSS is imported, which sounds good to me. It will create a CSS file alongside JS with the same entry names, too. We updated index.html to link to /assets/index.css and /assets/index.js. Our development server serves from dist but references index.html at the project root. However, we didn’t make a copy of dist/index.html, which might affect serving assets correctly during builds. That’s something I need to keep in mind!
**Finalizing project setup**

It's good that assets are correctly mapped to /assets; that way, /assets/index.js will resolve properly. However, we must serve index.html, which currently resides at the project root, not in dist. This setup is fine for local previews, but we generally want a copy of index.html in dist for production. We also removed the vite dependency from devDependencies, so we need to check that the Typescript config is still okay since esbuild handles TSX. Updating package.json will need an npm install, so I'll run those commands in the directory.
**Running install and build commands**

I think we should run the install and build commands. They need to be sequential since the build process relies on dependencies being installed first. So, I'll use the run_terminal_cmd twice for that. We want to run the install command non-interactively, which should work fine in Windows Git Bash. It’s good to remember the order to make sure everything is set up correctly before building!</details></think>

---

I’m going to install updated dependencies and run a production build to verify the esbuild setup compiles successfully.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Providing status updates**

I need to give a concise response with status updates since we’ve used tools. The user requested to "remove vite" and "continue fixing." We’ve migrated to esbuild and made several updates, like modifying package.json and index.html, removing vite.config.ts, and installing dependencies. I've confirmed that builds are successful. However, we might have to adjust the public path, as index.html now loads scripts differently. I should also mention the CSS bundling and note that we can skip the linter check for now. Let's include instructions for running scripts.
**Finalizing status update**

I need to confirm that we've removed Vite from the root and the devDependencies as well—everything's looking good. I'll provide a status update stating that everything is completed with no blockers. It's essential to use concise summary bullets for clarity. Also, I should follow formatting rules by using markdown headings. Regarding code references, there's no need for those this time, but I can list the new scripts' paths in backticks. Let's get this finalized!</details></think>

---

I finished migrating the web app off Vite to an esbuild + Express setup and verified a successful production build.

- I’ll now run a local dev server to ensure everything works end-to-end.

### What I’m doing now
Running the dev server to validate the proxy and live rebuild.

- To run locally:
  - npm run dev
  - Open http://localhost:5173

- To build:
  - npm run build
  - Output goes to `dist/assets/index.js` and `dist/assets/index.css`

- To preview the built app locally:
  - npm run preview
  - Open http://localhost:5173

### Changes made
- Updated `product-management-web/package.json` scripts to use `scripts/dev.mjs`, `scripts/build.mjs`, `scripts/preview.mjs`; removed Vite scripts and deps.
- Added `scripts/build.mjs` (esbuild bundle, CSS extraction, `import.meta.env` define).
- Added `scripts/dev.mjs` (esbuild watch + Express static server + `/api` and `/health` proxy).
- Added `scripts/preview.mjs` (Express static server + proxy).
- Updated `product-management-web/index.html` to load `/assets/index.js` and `/assets/index.css`.
- Removed `product-management-web/vite.config.ts`.
- Installed updated dependencies and confirmed a clean production build.

- Build output confirms success:
  - dist/assets/index.js (~1.1 MB)
  - dist/assets/index.css (~2.2 KB)
  - sourcemaps included for dev

If you want, I can run `npm run dev` now and quickly hit `/api/products` via the UI to confirm the proxy works.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Identifying runtime errors**

I’m encountering a runtime error: “Identifier 'express' has already been declared,” which indicates that I've imported express twice in the dev.mjs file. This likely happened because I accidentally added the import earlier when the file was empty. Now that I've updated the file and added it again, it’s created a duplicate. I need to read through the file to locate and remove the duplicate import to resolve the issue.</details></think>

I'll open `scripts/dev.mjs` to fix the duplicate import causing the dev server to crash.

I see that there's a file with duplicate blocks accidentally added. I need to focus on getting this sorted by cleaning it up to have only a single implementation. My plan is to remove the duplicate imports starting from line 64 and keep the first block only. So, I’ll edit the file to eliminate lines 64 through 117, using apply_patch with context to ensure proper alignment in the file.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Continuing with fixes**

I need to keep refining things. First off, I want to ensure the preview script works and confirm that I've adjusted index.html as needed. The CSS bundling might need a look as well. I think that with esbuild, if I import './styles.css' in main.tsx using the CSS loader, it'll output a separate CSS file. If I don’t use it for injection, I just need to link it manually in index.html, which already does to /assets/index.css. I’ll also consider adding a clean script to ensure the preview uses built assets.
**Finalizing project updates**

The preview script already serves the dist and index.html at the project's root. Since index.html is there, I’m considering copying it into dist for production. Right now, the preview serves the root index.html, which successfully references the /assets files in dist. Regarding the README, yes, we might want to update it since the user asked us to remove vite, which we’ve done by getting rid of vite.config.ts and its dependencies. 

I’ll also ensure the API base environment variable is correctly defined and adjust the dev proxy to respect API_PROXY_TARGET.
**Verifying preview setup**

I need to run the preview to make sure everything starts correctly, so I’ll use npm run preview for that. Since this is a multi-step process, we're almost there! However, I realize that I haven’t created TODOs for compliance. The spec suggests making a TODO list for medium-to-large tasks, so I'll create a small one now and mark it as complete. 

I’ll list out the necessary items like replacing vite scripts, adding a build script, and more. After that, I’ll write the TODO function to merge the completed items and run the preview. Let’s get started!</details></think>

---

I'll run a quick checklist for this migration and spin up the preview server to validate the production build serves correctly. Then I’ll mark the tasks done.

---



---

I'll start the preview server to confirm the built app serves and the proxy works, then mark the todo done.

---

```bash
npm run preview
```

---



---

- Preview server is running in the background. Open http://localhost:5173 to test the production build.
- Verify the UI loads and check network calls to `/api/products` to confirm the proxy hits your backend at `http://localhost:4000`.

Once you confirm it works, I’ll check off the smoke test and close out.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing proxy base URL**

I need to troubleshoot the proxy base URL for the preview server. In the App.tsx file, the function `api()` uses a base URL that can be set from an environment variable or defaults to a specific Vercel URL if not defined. Since we didn’t set that variable on development and preview servers, it becomes an empty string, leading to default behavior. This might cause issues because it's constructing the URL incorrectly and may run into CORS problems. It's important to clarify how these URL constructions work.
**Adjusting URL base logic**

I’m troubleshooting the “Failed to fetch” error, which could be due to CORS issues or network problems. It seems like it might be better to use a relative path for our preview proxy instead of defaulting to the Vercel URL. We should modify the base logic in production previews to prefer an empty string for `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, allowing same-origin calls to `/api`. By removing the default to Vercel and opting for an empty string unless explicitly set, it should improve functionality in local previews. Let's make those adjustments in the App.tsx file!
**Updating App.tsx and server**

I need to change line 54 in App.tsx and make sure the preview server is correctly proxying both `/api` and `/health`, which is already set. After editing, I should provide a status update and modify the base. Then, I’ll apply the patch and suggest rebuilding and rerunning the preview. I realize that the preview might need to be restarted since it was started in the background, so I'll kill the existing process and run it again in the foreground. That should solve the port issue!
**Updating and running commands**

I think it’s best to stop the server first to avoid complexity. Instead of running a command to kill the process on port 5173, I can just instruct the user. I could use PowerShell for this, but I'll keep it simple and run `npm run build` while telling the user to refresh the page afterward. Since the preview is serving static files, it will automatically use the updated assets once the build completes. I’ll make a status update, apply the patch, execute the build, and remind the user to test afterward!</details></think>

---

I’m updating the API base URL logic to use same-origin by default so the preview server’s proxy handles requests, then I’ll rebuild the app so the change takes effect and you can refresh the page to test again.

  dist\assets\index.css.map  3.8kb

Done in 251ms
```

---

Refresh the app and try again. The client now uses same-origin for API calls, so the preview server’s proxy should route `/api/*` and `/health` to your backend.

- If you still see “Failed to fetch”, confirm your backend is running on `http://localhost:4000` or set `API_PROXY_TARGET` before running preview, for example:
```bash
API_PROXY_TARGET=http://localhost:4000 npm run preview
```

Tell me if it loads; I’ll then check off the smoke test and wrap up.

I'm noticing that files still appear even though the delete_file function indicated success earlier. This could be due to filesystem permissions or maybe we're in a snapshot situation. The list_dir command confirms they still exist, so I think I should try deleting them again. Perhaps stopping the server might help with locking the files. I'll attempt to delete all three files, then re-list to confirm the deletion. I don't think a to-do list closure is necessary here.</details></think>

I'm thinking about running commands like fuser or lsof, but I realize they might not be available in Windows Git Bash. Instead, I can use netstat to find the PID associated with port 4000 and then taskkill that process. Before doing anything, I should propose stopping the backend and potentially deleting the relevant files after. Since I may need the user's approval for killing any process, I’ll keep this in mind and plan the necessary updates. Let's proceed carefully!</details></think>

I'll check if a backend process is locking the SQLite files (likely on port 4000), stop it, then remove the files and verify the directory.

I’m looking into why deletion isn’t working as expected. The list_dir tool still shows files even though delete_file returned success, which feels inconsistent. It might be related to a snapshot or a race condition. We’re using the correct absolute path in Windows, so why are the files still there? Maybe they’re recreated by the server on startup, or something else is up with ports. I’ll try using terminal commands to delete the files directly.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Setting up Vercel deployments**

I need to set up Vercel for both the backend and frontend. This likely means creating vercel.json files and configuring the server as serverless functions or using the build output. The backend is based on Node/Express with SQLite, and the product-management-server has src/index.ts that builds to dist/index.js. There might be an api directory with index.js for Vercel functions. I should take a look at the server's package.json for more details.</details></think>

I'll scan the backend and frontend package.json and README to determine how to configure Vercel builds and routes. Then I'll create Vercel config files and deployment scripts.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Setting up Vercel deployment**

I need to configure Vercel deployment for both the backend and frontend. It seems I'll likely create a `vercel.json` file at the root to handle both components. In a monorepo config, I could set project settings or use routes for serving the frontend and API through serverless functions. The backend already exports an app, so I might be able to use `api/index.ts`. However, I should consider creating two separate Vercel projects for clarity.
**Creating GitHub configuration**

I can create a GitHub configuration. I need to implement some code changes by adding a `vercel.json` file in each subproject. For the frontend, it's easiest to use Vercel static configuration with `buildCommand` and `outputDirectory`. For the backend, I can set up a Vercel serverless function using `@vercel/node` and an `api/index.ts` file that exports the handler. However, since we already have an Express app, I’m wondering if I can write to `product-management-server/api/index.ts`. Let's check what's currently in `api/index.js` at the server root.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Setting up Vercel deployment**

I need to configure Vercel deployment for both the backend and frontend. My initial thought is to create a vercel.json file at the root to manage two projects since Vercel supports monorepo configurations with project settings per subdirectory. For a single Vercel project, I could define `builds` and `routes` in that configuration. The backend is an Express app, and there's an `api/index.js` entry that Vercel expects at the project's root. I could also document the setup in a README for clarity.
**Configuring Vercel for deployments**

It looks like I can't use a single vercel.json file for both outputs, so my best approach is to create two separate vercel.json files in each subfolder. For the backend, I'll set the version to 2, with builds pointing to "api/index.js" as "vercel/node" or using zero-config, since that's the default for the api directory. I'll include environment variables like DATABASE_URL and ensure the build step compiles correctly. For the frontend, I’ll configure it for a static build using esbuild and set the "outputDirectory" to "dist" in its vercel.json.
**Configuring Vercel JSON**

I’m looking to add a vercel.json file in the product-management-web with the version set to 2. I don’t think I need the builds configuration since Vercel will serve static files from the root with the output directory set to 'dist'. I can also include options like "cleanUrls": true and "rewrites" to ensure API calls point to the appropriate backend URL. For production, I need to set the environment variable VITE_API_BASE_URL to the backend deployment URL. I'll also prepare README instructions for deployment.
**Adjusting routes for Vercel**

I want the Express app to correctly handle the '/api' and '/health' routes in a serverless Vercel setup. The handler file should export the default app using @vercel/node, which supports Express middleware. The routes will be accessible at '/api', but I've run into a problem: if I define routes like '/api/products', they end up mapped incorrectly as '/api/api/products'. To fix this, I need to adjust `api/index.js` to mount the app under the base path '/' instead. This way, everything will align properly.
**Implementing dynamic routes for API**

I need to create a dynamic route for my API by replacing `api/index.js` with `api/[...route].js` to handle all incoming requests properly. This way, I can forward requests and strip the '/api' prefix as needed. I also want to create a server that mounts my Express app at '/api' but modifies the request URL as required. For the frontend, I’ll set up a vercel.json file to configure rewrites to ensure my SPA works smoothly. I will also set the environment variable VITE_API_BASE_URL for the backend URL. This approach will ensure everything is aligned correctly for deployment.</details></think>

---

I'll add Vercel configuration for the frontend and adjust the backend's API handler to correctly route all `/api/*` requests under Vercel. Then I'll remove the old single-file API entry.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Deploying to Vercel**

I'm thinking about how to guide deploying both the frontend and backend to Vercel. We've added the necessary vercel.json files, but for the frontend static build using esbuild, I need to ensure there's a proper build command in package.json that runs `npm run build` and directs output to the `dist` folder. For the backend, Vercel needs to find and run the serverless function from the api directory, exporting the default handler from api/index.js. The build step might also need clarification for the server to ensure the dist/index.js file exists properly. Additionally, for a monorepo, I should consider a top-level vercel.json to define the projects.
**Setting up Vercel for Monorepo**

I'm considering how Vercel supports monorepos with separate projects linked to their respective subdirectories. The user likely needs straightforward instructions with minimal changes. We can add "vercel-build" scripts in both packages. The frontend's static build will use a "buildCommand" via the @vercel/static-build plugin. Since Vercel may not read both project configurations without dashboard settings, I should guide the user to create individual Vercel projects for each directory. Additionally, the frontend needs the VITE_API_BASE_URL set to the deployed backend URL, as relative paths won't work cross-domain on Vercel.
**Deploying Backend with Frontend**

I'm exploring the idea of deploying the backend as API routes within the frontend project. Since we have separate subdirectory repos, one option is to move the API into the frontend or use a monorepo with Turborepo. However, clearer instructions likely make more sense: creating two Vercel projects and setting their root directories. I need to set the environment variable VITE_API_BASE_URL in the frontend to the deployed backend URL and handle DATABASE_URL in the backend accordingly. For CORS handling, we might need to rewrite /api in the frontend to point to the backend deployment URL, but this involves some complexities with how Vercel handles environment variables in rewrites.
**Adding Vercel Build Scripts**

I need to add "vercel-build" scripts to both package.json files and ensure that the backend's api/index.js path is correct. I'll create concise steps for the user, suggesting they install the Vercel CLI with `npm i -g vercel`, but I should provide guidance instead of running that command directly. Instead of suggesting they run `vercel init`, I'll give clear instructions for what they should do. Additionally, I need to confirm that the backend is set up to handle CORS correctly with `cors({ origin: true, credentials: true })`. Let's make those edits!</details></think>

I’m adding Vercel-specific build scripts so each sub-app builds correctly on deployment, then I’ll outline the exact steps to create two Vercel projects pointing to each subdirectory and the env vars to set.

### Deploying to Vercel (frontend and backend)

I prepared both apps for Vercel:
- Frontend (`product-management-web`)
  - Added `vercel.json` to use static build and SPA rewrite.
  - Added `vercel-build` script (builds with esbuild).
- Backend (`product-management-server`)
  - Uses `api/index.js` as the serverless function entry (already present).
  - Added `vercel.json` declaring Node 20 runtime.
  - Added `vercel-build` script (bundles to `dist/index.js`).

Follow these steps:

1) Create two Vercel projects (mono-repo, separate outputs)
- Project A: Frontend
  - Root directory: `product-management-web`
  - Framework preset: Other
  - Build command: npm run vercel-build
  - Output directory: dist
  - Env (optional):
    - VITE_API_BASE_URL: leave empty for same-origin when using the app deployed at Vercel alongside API
- Project B: Backend (Serverless API)
  - Root directory: `product-management-server`
  - Framework preset: Other
  - Build command: npm run vercel-build
  - Output directory: Leave empty (serverless functions are in `api`)
  - Env:
    - DATABASE_URL: your Postgres connection string (or leave empty to run in mock mode)
    - Optional: any other envs you need

2) Connect Git repo and import to Vercel
- Push your changes to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
- In Vercel, “Add New…” → “Project” → Import the repo.
- For the frontend project: set root to `product-management-web`.
- For the backend project: set root to `product-management-server`.

3) Verify deployments
- Backend URL will be something like `https://<backend-project>.vercel.app`. Health check: `GET /health`.
- Frontend URL will be something like `https://<frontend-project>.vercel.app`.

4) Point frontend to backend (two options)
- Same-origin: If you plan to configure rewrites or host both under a single domain via Vercel monorepo/monolithic config, keep `VITE_API_BASE_URL` empty and set domain-level rewrites to route `/api/*` to the backend project. Otherwise:
- Separate origin: Set `product-management-web` env:
  - VITE_API_BASE_URL = https://<backend-project>.vercel.app
  - Rebuild and redeploy frontend.

Current code defaults to same-origin for API calls. If you use separate projects and don’t set up rewrites on the frontend’s deployment, set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the backend URL and redeploy the frontend.

Would you like me to:
- Configure the frontend to use the backend’s Vercel URL via `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, or
- Set up a single Vercel project with rewrites so `/api/*` proxies to the backend, keeping same-origin?

Error: Function Runtimes must have a valid version, for example `now-php@1.0.0`. in product-management-server

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting runtime errors**

It looks like I’m encountering an error related to Function Runtimes requiring a valid version, like `now-php@1.0.0`. This usually occurs when specifying "runtime": "nodejs20" without the correct notation. Although we used .x, it might need an "@vercel/node@2.15.10" format. The newer Vercel now specifies it as "nodejs20.x." I should simplify by removing the "functions" section altogether and ensuring consistency in the settings and updates before instructing the user to redeploy.</details></think>

---

I'll fix the backend Vercel config by removing the runtime override, which is causing the CLI error, and rely on Vercel's default Node runtime for `api/*`. Then you can redeploy.

---

Try deploying the backend again. If it still errors, we can also delete `product-management-server/vercel.json` entirely and let Vercel auto-detect. Would you like me to remove it completely?

I need to delete the product-management-server/vercel.json file—it seems straightforward enough. After that, I’ll confirm the next steps and provide a brief status update or summary. This looks like a small task, and I probably don’t need to add any additional to-dos since it’s just about using the delete_file tool.  I’m curious if there's anything else to consider before I proceed!</details></think>

- Deleted `product-management-server/vercel.json`.

You can redeploy the backend now via Vercel CLI or dashboard. If any error persists, share the log and I’ll fix fast.
