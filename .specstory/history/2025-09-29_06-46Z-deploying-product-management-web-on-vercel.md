I need to address the 404 errors on Vercel for the SPA, which might be due to missing rewrites in the vercel.json file. There is a vercel.json file in the product-management-web directory that I should check. I’ll use tools for this and provide a status update while potentially reading files in parallel. I’ll look at the product-management-web/vercel.json, package.json, index.html, and possibly the README, along with any build scripts. Let’s run those parallel reads!</details></think>

I'll check the web app's Vercel configuration and routing to see why SPA routes might 404 after deploy, then adjust the configuration if needed.

I'll open the build and dev scripts to ensure the dist output matches Vercel's expectations and that the SPA rewrite is correct.
